## PROJECT EXPERIENCE

#### *Master Period*

**Key technology and system of quality inspection with independent learning ability-Ministry of Science and Technology Innovation 2030-"New Generation Artificial Intelligence" major project**

* **About**: Core member, Xi'an Jiaotong University, Institute of Artificial Intelligence and Robotics(***IAIR***), October 2021 - October 2023, Xi'an
* **Project Introduction**: As a core member of project topic 5 "Quality inspection system and verification demonstration for typical industries", it is mainly responsible for supporting hybrid inspection of imaging and perceptual reasoning, learning and decision-making System design and construction, research on defect detection algorithm based on few-shot learning. ***The previous work*** was mainly to use the newer target detection algorithm on the self-built data set to verify and demonstrate the detection task. We also proposed an improved FCOS algorithm combined with the spatial attention mechanism. ***The current work*** mainly focuses on the research of few-sample unsupervised or semi-supervised algorithms using the few abnormal samples and more normal samples in the field of industrial defect detection.
* **Project Achievements**:
* ***IEEE Transactions on Instrumentation and Measurement( TIM, JCR Q1/SCI Area 2) (in process)***
* ***One invention patent (second work, excluding tutor), "an industrial defect detection optimization method, system, device, equipment and storage medium"***
* ***more coming soon...***

#### *Bachelor Period*

**Intelligent Medical Cabinet Based on Machine Learning**

* **About**: Principal, Zhengzhou University, Software College, Mar 2021 - May 2021, Zhengzhou

* **Project Introduction**: As a person in charge, I organized the development of "Machine-based intelligent medical cabinet" intelligent medical project, mainly responsible for the development of the web end, APP end and back-end algorithm  modules. After reviewing the relevant literature and combines its own ability, I  decided to divide the algorithm analysis into: collecting data pretreatment, the old man's health indicator, a large amount of data logic regression classification, and the results visualize. When implementing the classification, I use the F value formula to make different Threshold minimum, and realize personalized model training.During the development process, I will use the theory, development knowledge, and IoT idea to the project, greatly deepened my understanding of these knowledge.
* **Project Achievements**:
* ***This project won the 2021 Chinese College Student Computer Design Competition Henan Provincial San Salancing Award.***

**IntelligentData Smart Gloves**

* **About**: Core member, Zhengzhou University, Software College, May 2020 - Dec 2020, Zhengzhou
* **Project Introduction**: I have participated in the research and development process of the team's "IntelligentData-Smart Glove" project and is responsible for analyzing patient rehabilitation data.The project uses mirroring therapy to help patients carry out hand rehabilitation.I divide the data analysis process into: collected data pretreatment, patient finger curvature regression, patient rehabilitation neural network classification and other steps and use Tensorflow  and other libraries to  complete     the establishment and programming of the patient's finger curvature prediction model and the like.In the process of research and development, I applied machine learning knowledge to actual and strengthened their understanding.
* **Project Achievements**:
* ***This project won the third prize of the 14th ICAN International Innovation Entrepreneurship Competition.***
