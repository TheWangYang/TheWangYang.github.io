## PROJECT EXPERIENCE
#### Intelligent medical cabinet based on machine learning 
#### principal Zhengzhou University Software College Mar 2021 - May 2021 Zhengzhou

As a person in charge, I organized the development of "Machine-based intelligent medical cabinet" intelligent medical project, mainly responsible for the development of the web end, APP  end  and  back-end  algorithm  modules.After reviewing the relevant literature and combines its own ability, I  decided to  divide the algorithm analysis into: collecting   data pretreatment, the old man's health indicator, a large amount of data logic regression classification, and the results visualize.When implementing the classification, I use the F  value formula to  make different Threshold minimum, and  realize personalized model training.During the development process, I will use the theory, development knowledge, and I. IoT idea to the project, greatly deepened my understanding of these knowledge.
This project won the 2021 Chinese College Student Computer Design Competition Henan Provincial San Salancing Award.

#### IntelligentData- smart gloves
#### Core member Zhengzhou University Software College May 2020 - Dec 2020 Zhengzhou

I have participated in the research and development process of the team's "IntelligentData-Smart Glove" project and is responsible for analyzing patient rehabilitation data.The project uses mirroring therapy to help patients carry out hand rehabilitation.I divide the data analysis process into: collected data pretreatment, patient finger curvature regression, patient rehabilitation neural network classification and other steps and use Tensorflow  and other libraries to  complete     the establishment and programming of the patient's finger curvature prediction model and the like.In the process of research and development, I applied machine learning knowledge to actual and strengthened their understanding.
This project won the third prize of the 14th ICAN International Innovation Entrepreneurship Competition.
